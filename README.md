# AI-Lead-Automation
This project implements an AI-driven lead handling automation using n8n and a Large Language Model (LLM). The system accepts incoming lead messages via a webhook, classifies intent, extracts structured data, stores it in a mock datastore, and sends an AI-generated automated response.
